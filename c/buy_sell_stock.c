/*
Problem Statement: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
You are given an array prices where prices[i] represents the price of a given stock on the i'thday.

Your task is to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and a different day in the future to sell that stock.

If no profit can be achieved, return 0.

Constraints:
You may not engage in multiple transactions (i.e., you can only buy and sell once).

Example:
Input:
prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]

Output:
5

Explanation:
Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6âˆ’1=5.

Input:
prices = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]

Output:
0

Explanation:
In this case, no transaction is done as no profit is possible.

Objective:
Write a function that takes an array of integers prices and returns the maximum profit that can be achieved.

    if(max_profit< arr[i]-min){
      max_profit = arr[i]- min;

{
  int prices[] = {7, 2, 8, 1, 3};
